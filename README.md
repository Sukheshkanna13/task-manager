Task Manager Prototype

This repository contains a basic prototype for a task manager or todo list application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus of this project is to provide a simple interface for users to input and manage tasks, with a key feature being the ability to store task data locally in the browser's storage.

Features:

Task Input: Users can input tasks through a user-friendly interface.
Local Storage: Task data is stored locally in the browser's storage, ensuring persistence even after the page is refreshed or closed.
Retrieval: The application retrieves stored task data from local storage, allowing users to access previously entered tasks.
Usage:

Adding Tasks: Users can add tasks by entering task details into the provided input fields and clicking the "Add" button.
Persistence: Task data is automatically stored in the browser's local storage upon addition.
Retrieval: Upon reloading or revisiting the page, the application retrieves stored task data from local storage, allowing users to view and manage previously entered tasks.
How to Run:

Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to access the task manager application. No additional setup or installation is required.
